Program Logic

Initialize a variable sum to 0.

Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 50 (inclusive).

Add each number to the sum during each iteration.

Print the final value of sum.



How to Run

Save the code in a file, from task 1 or task2 in .py file for example sum.py(from task2)

Run the script using Python

note:
